# Pricing-Table

# Overview :
It's three pricing categories small, medium, and large prices and it shows the customers which features they'll get based on which one they're going to subscribe to.

By using the Flex-box, the width of each of the pricing cards changes dynamically based on the width that's defined.

And it's responsive in the way that when the window goes below a certain size, it stacks the three pricing cards vertically rather than having them horizontally as shown in the original window size.

# Technology :
- HTML.
- CSS.
